<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


https://github.com/KelvinPhu/Project-FullStack-Employee-System-CRUD/assets/102346766/88da4bd0-14ac-4345-bea2-78e1dfceb608


The Project-FullStack-Employee-System-CRUD is a comprehensive application designed to manage employee data effectively through a user-friendly interface. This project integrates a backend API, crafted in Java, with a frontend developed in ReactJS, offering a seamless interaction experience for users. Here's a brief overview of its core functionalities:

### Create New Employee
Users can add new employees to the system by filling out a form with employee details such as name, department, and contact information. This data is then sent to the backend server where it's processed and stored.

### Read Employee (Display Employee Information)
The application allows users to view a list of all employees currently stored in the database. Users can click on an employee to view more detailed information. This is particularly useful for HR departments needing quick access to employee records.

### Update Employee Information
Should there be any changes to an employee's details, the system provides an option to update their information. Users can edit fields such as employee name, department, and job title, ensuring that the database is always up-to-date.


### Delete Employee
The system also enables the deletion of employee records. This function can be used to remove employees who have left the company, helping maintain a clean and accurate database.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


Setting up a full-stack project like the Project-FullStack-Employee-System-CRUD locally involves several steps, from initial setup to running the project. 
This guide assumes you have some basic familiarity with Java for the backend, ReactJS for the frontend, and MySQL for the database.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 11 or newer installed on your machine.
- MySQL Server: Make sure MySQL Server is installed and running.
- Node.js and npm: Required for running the ReactJS frontend.
- IDE or Editor: IntelliJ IDEA or Spring Tool Suite for backend and VS Code for frontend development are recommended.

### Backend Setup (Spring Boot)
* Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository to your local machine.
  ```sh
  git clone [Your Repository URL]
  cd [Your Project's Backend Directory]
  ```

* Database Configuration: Open src/main/resources/application.yaml (or application.properties) in your backend project and configure your MySQL database connection:
  ```sh
  # configuration with application.yml file
  spring:
    datasource:
      url: jdbc:sqlserver://THIEN-PHU:1433;databaseName=PracticeJavaSpringReactJS;encrypt=false
      driverClassName: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
      username: sa
      password: 123456789Thien_Phu
  
    jpa:
      hibernate:
        ddl-auto: update
      properties:
        hibernate:
          dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.SQLServerDialect
      show-sql: true
  ```

* Run the Application: You can run the Spring Boot application directly from your IDE by running the main class annotated with @SpringBootApplication, or use Maven from the command line:
  ```sh
  ./mvnw spring-boot:run
  ```
  
* Verify Backend: Once started, ensure the backend is running correctly by accessing or the configured port.
    ```sh
  http://localhost:8080
  ```

### Frontend Setup (ReactJS)

* Navigate to the Frontend Directory: After setting up the backend, open a new terminal window and navigate to your project's frontend directory.
  ```sh
  cd [Your Project's Frontend Directory]
  ```

* Install Dependencies: Install the required npm packages.
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

* Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the root of your frontend project if you have any environment-specific settings (e.g., the backend API URL).
  ```sh
  REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
  ```
  
* Run the Frontend: Start the React application.
    ```sh
  npm start
  ```

### Testing the Full-Stack Application

* Access the Application: With both backend and frontend running, open your browser and go to `$ http://localhost:3000`. You should see your full-stack application running.
  
* Use the Application: Test the CRUD functionalities by creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee entries.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Troubleshooting

* Database Connection: If the backend can't connect to the database, check your MySQL service and ensure the credentials in `$ application.properties` are correct.
* Port Conflicts: If you encounter port conflicts (e.g., if port 8080 or 3000 is already in use), you can change the port in the backend's `$ application.properties` file `$ (server.port=yourNewPort)` and the frontend's `$ .env` file, if applicable.
* Dependencies: If you face issues with missing or incompatible npm packages, ensure you've run `$ npm install` from within the frontend directory and that your `$ package.json` file is correctly set up.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The Project-FullStack-Employee-System-CRUD provides a comprehensive platform for managing employee information. This section will guide you through some of the common use cases and functionalities you can leverage within the system. 
Here, youâ€™ll find examples of how to perform CRUD operations, including adding a new employee, viewing employee details, updating employee information, and deleting an employee.

### Adding a New Employee
To add a new employee, navigate to the "Add Employee" section of the application. Fill out the form with the employee's details, such as name, email, job title, and department. Once completed, submit the form to save the new employee to the database.

`$ Example:`

![1](https://github.com/KelvinPhu/Project-FullStack-Employee-System-CRUD/assets/102346766/20405ba3-145a-40eb-ad53-c65c78fc6fa0)

`$ code example`
```
fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/employees', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Jane Doe',
    email: 'jane.doe@example.com',
    jobTitle: 'Software Engineer',
    department: 'Engineering',
  }),
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log('Success:', data))
.catch((error) => console.error('Error:', error));
```

### Viewing Employee Details
The main dashboard lists all employees. Click on an employee's name to view more detailed information about their profile. This page will display all the relevant information, such as contact details, department, and job title.

![2](https://github.com/KelvinPhu/Project-FullStack-Employee-System-CRUD/assets/102346766/aa484109-fecf-4d90-ad0a-6436d0ccbcad)

### Updating Employee Information
To update an employee's information, navigate to the employee's detail page and click the "Edit" button. Modify the fields as needed in the form and submit it to update the employee's details in the database.

![3](https://github.com/KelvinPhu/Project-FullStack-Employee-System-CRUD/assets/102346766/8fc3a63e-eaad-4e44-bd32-98e1635b37ed)


`$ Example:`

```
fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Jane Doe Updated',
    email: 'jane.updated@example.com',
    jobTitle: 'Senior Software Engineer',
    department: 'Engineering',
  }),
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log('Update Successful:', data))
.catch((error) => console.error('Error:', error));
```

### Deleting an Employee
If you need to remove an employee from the system, locate the employee you wish to delete in the main dashboard. Click on the "Delete" button next to their name to remove their information from the database.

`$ Example:`

```ReactJS
fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1', {
  method: 'DELETE',
})
.then(() => console.log('Delete successful'))
.catch((error) => console.error('Error:', error));
```
